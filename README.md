# TicketApp — Multi-framework implementations

This workspace contains three separate frontend implementations for the "Frontend Stage 2 — Multi-Framework Ticket Web App" challenge:

- `react-app` — React + Vite implementation (working, contains mock API and full CRUD flows)
- `vue-app` — placeholder/skeleton to scaffold a Vue + Vite implementation that mirrors the React app
- `twig-app` — placeholder/skeleton to scaffold a PHP + Twig implementation (server-rendered templates)

The implementations should share the same visual language and behavior:
- Wavy hero and decorative circles, centered layout with max-width 1440px
- Authentication simulated via localStorage under `ticketapp_session`
- Dashboard and Ticket Management pages with full CRUD (tickets stored under `ticketapp_tickets` via mock API for SPA versions)
- Form validation (title required, status restricted to `open`, `in_progress`, `closed`), inline errors, and toast feedback
- Accessible dialogs with keyboard handling and focus management

What I added in this commit/session:
- Improved/expanded React README is present in `react-app/README.md`.
- Created skeleton folders `vue-app/` and `twig-app/` with READMEs describing the next steps for scaffolding.

What I can do next (pick one):
- Scaffold the Vue app (Vite + Vue Router + Pinia), port React components and styles.
- Scaffold the Twig app (basic PHP dev server, Twig templates, copy the shared CSS and simple client-side JS to mimic the React behavior via localStorage).
- Add unit tests for validators and minimal integration tests for the React app.

Tell me which to start with and I'll scaffold it and port the shared assets and mock API. If you want me to fully replace or expand the existing React README, say so and I'll overwrite it with the expanded version.
